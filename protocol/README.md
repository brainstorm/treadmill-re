Here are the key byte values involved in communication, which we can use to create a sample session:

## Initialization:

* 0xF8: Set as a control value, likely to initialize or configure UART.
* 0x08: Enables UART functionality.

Transmission Bytes:

* 0xF7: A possible command or start signal for transmitting data.
* 0x34: A specific byte set within g_tx_data, potentially indicating a mode or subcommand.

Buffer Size and Addressing:

* 0x80: Size of the tx_buffer.
* 0x11, 0x51: Used as indices in g_tx_data for specific fields (energy and status_flags).

## Sample Communication Session

Initialization:

* Send 0xF8 to set up UART.
* Set 0x08 on `REG_UART1_CR2` to enable transmission.

Sending Command:

* Send 0xF7 as a command identifier.
* Send 0x34 for mode setting.

Additional data could include values at indices 0x11 and 0x51 for specific information like energy and status flags.

## Reception:

Wait for data bytes to appear in `rx_buffer`, checking `rx_count` for the number of received bytes.
